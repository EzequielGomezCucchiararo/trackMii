# TRACKMII - A dinamic realtime geolocation tracker

## Description

This is the final project for [Skylab Coders](http://www.skylabcoders.com/en/) Bootcamp (3rd Edition), and Its main utility is that it allows users to know where other online users are.

As a mobile web application, It uses the socket.io real time engine [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and MEAN JavaScript software stack.

As a user you can create an account, log in, create groups and invite people by email notifications.

Once you are log in and participating in a group, you can open a Google Map View where you can find the location of each online member.

Can be seen online at: https://trackmii.herokuapp.com/
